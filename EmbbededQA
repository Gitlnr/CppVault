1)Explain what happens in memory when a class in C++ has virtual functions.
How is vtable structured?
Where is vptr stored?
What happens when we call a virtual function using a base class pointer?
Answer:
VTable (Virtual Table):
Created per class that has at least one virtual function
It contains function addresses of the virtual functions

VPTR (Virtual Pointer):
Stored inside each object instance
It points to that class's vtable

Behavior with Base Pointer:
When calling a function like:
Base* ptr = new Derived(); ptr->virtualFunc();
The vptr inside the object points to Derived's vtable, so Derived's function is executed, not Baseâ€™s.
