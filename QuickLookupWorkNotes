| Term                                          | Meaning                                                                        |

| **Framework development**                     | Creating a reusable foundation or library for others to build applications on. |
| **Application development using a framework** | Using an existing framework (like VCL/MFC) to make a specific product or tool. |

You are doing the **second one** ✅ — developing *applications using existing frameworks*, not *creating a new framework*.
### ⚙️ Example (optional)
> “For example, I used the VCL framework to design the main GUI screen of our control software, 
   connect UI buttons to C++ functions, and communicate with external devices via LAN.”
