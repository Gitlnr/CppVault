What is structure ?
Structure a collection of variable of different datatypes.

Uses cases ?
For example I know the smartphone has model name, memory size,color ,price .Instead of creating a same dataypes again and again to get rid of this C/C++ structure(struct) is used.

Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

struct Smartphone {
  string modelName;
  int memorySize;
  string color;
  float price;
};

void printSmartPhoneInfo(Smartphone smartphone){
 cout << smartphone.modelName << endl; 
 cout << smartphone.memorySize << endl; 
 cout << smartphone.color  << endl; 
 cout << smartphone.price  << endl; 
}
int main(){
  Smartphone smartphone1;
 // memset(&smartphone1 ,0, sizeof(Smartphone));//memset was removed as it is not appropriate for initializing non-POD types like std::string
//While it is fine for simple POD (Plain Old Data) types like int, char, or float, it is not safe for objects like std::string, which manage memory dynamically.

  smartphone1.modelName = "Iphone14";
  smartphone1.memorySize = 128;
  smartphone1.color = "Purple";
  smartphone1.price =  999.9;

  printSmartPhoneInfo(smartphone1);
  cout<<endl;
  Smartphone smartphone2;
 // memset(&smartphone2 ,0, sizeof(Smartphone));

  smartphone2.modelName = "Galaxy S4";
  smartphone2.memorySize = 128;
  smartphone2.color = "Blue";
  smartphone2.price =  999;

  printSmartPhoneInfo(smartphone2);
  
  return 0;
}
